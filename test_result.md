# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Build a web app that helps users write entire books with AI. The app should guide users through creating book projects, generating AI outlines, and writing chapters with Gemini AI assistance. CONTINUATION REQUEST: Fix several issues - app crashes after outline generation but outline is still created, need loading screens during generation, HTML code blocks appearing in edited text, export book and save chapter buttons not working, and poor text formatting with everything attached without proper spacing. NEW CONTINUATION REQUEST: 1 want to use Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite instead of the model i use now, i want the user to be able to download the book in pdf or docx format and not only in html, i want the user to be able to choose between more styles, i want the prompt to be better optimized to get better result, and make sure that in each chapter is present the chapter name at the start of it. LATEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: 1) Maintain consistent point of view (avoid switching between first-person and third-person) 2) Improve language naturalness, especially in other languages like Italian 3) Optimize PDF and DOCX export speed and formatting 4) Include only title and table of contents in exports (remove outline section) 5) Fix Chapter 1 editor bug where content appears empty initially 6) Separate demo book from main page - create dedicated section for user's books. NEWEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: Refine and enhance literary content by addressing critical issues: lack of stylistic variety in dialogue and scenes, heavy descriptions with stiff language, generic chapter titles, characters speaking in same register as narrator, unnatural dialogue, narrative lacks balance between poetic and concrete scenes, emotionally artificial narration, and poor visual structure. CURRENT CONTINUATION REQUEST: Fix formatting consistency between PDF/DOCX exports, enable outline editing, improve export button placement, fix page scroll bug, enhance logo visibility, and implement additional authentication methods (email/password, Google, GitHub). LATEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: Finish the Google OAuth authentication implementation with provided credentials. CURRENT CONTINUATION REQUEST: Remove the logo from the dashboard and make the dashboard look more clean and more modern, professional and beautiful but include also all the most important info about the site, make also the login with google account better and add the email and password login method. NEW CONTINUATION REQUEST: remove the logo from the main page, and when logging in from the home page, after i log in with my email i get still taken to the home page and not the actual app, fix this things. LATEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: after i click generate book i got sent to a page where it says that that page hasn't been created yet, create, i think it has already been created but with a different style, fix that. NEWEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: the generate all chapters button doesn't work, in addiction when editing the outline i can't see the text because it is white over white, fix that, the Writing & Editing write is of a similar color of the bar so it difficult to read, the editing chapter window is a bit longer than its container so it overflow from the bottom, in addiction fix the fact that when clicking generate all the chapters you not remain in the same page but add a bit of loading bar or something to let the user know at which point is the work. CURRENT CONTINUATION REQUEST: many times when i run for the first time the web app i have the same problem, the google account auth doesn't work and i got sent to home page because it fails, fix this error and make sure that each time i start the web app the google auth works fine and i will never get this error anymore in the future. LATEST CONTINUATION REQUEST: implement a payment method to buy the credits like stripe or others. CURRENT CONTINUATION REQUEST: Fix the loading screen issue where app gets stuck after clicking 'Create Book Project' - resolve the outline generation stuck on loading screen problem."

      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "FIXED: Updated both handleFormSubmit and handleFormSubmitDirect functions to automatically generate outline after project creation. If outline generation succeeds, app goes directly to step 3 (outline review). If it fails, app stays on step 2 with manual generation option. Also updated step 2 UI to show either loading state or manual generation button based on outline generation status. ADDITIONAL FIX: Removed dual loading states issue from App.js - eliminated redundant appReady state that was causing infinite loading screen. Now AuthContext is the single source of truth for app initialization."

ROOT CAUSE: Frontend was trying to connect to localhost:8001 but in containerized environment, browser needs external URL.

    message: "FRONTEND TEXT INPUT FOCUS ISSUE TESTING REQUEST RECEIVED: The review request asks to test text input focus issues in the book creation form, which is a FRONTEND UI issue outside my testing scope. As a backend testing agent, I cannot test frontend UI interactions like text input focus, typing behavior, or form interactions. ✅ BACKEND DEPENDENCY FIX: Fixed missing jinja2 dependency that was preventing backend startup. ✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive content generation testing shows backend is working well with some word count issues. ✅ CRITICAL BACKEND FINDING: Enhanced content generation word count issue confirmed - Story style chapters generate only 19.6% of target words (1484/7562), Descriptive style achieves 62.9% (4760/7562). Story style also has poor paragraph formatting (0 paragraph breaks). RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should focus on frontend text input testing manually, while addressing the backend word count generation issue for story-style content."
